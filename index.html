        <h2>Mental Disorders</h2>
        <p>
          A mental disorder is characterized by a clinically significant
          disturbance in an individual’s cognition, emotional regulation, or
          behaviour. It is usually associated with distress or impairment in
          important areas of functioning. There are many different types of
          mental disorders. Mental disorders may also be referred to as mental
          health conditions. The latter is a broader term covering mental
          disorders, psychosocial disabilities and (other) mental states
          associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning, or
          risk of self-harm. This fact sheet focuses on mental disorders as
          described by the International Classification of Diseases 11th
          Revision (ICD-11). In 2019, 1 in every 8 people, or 970 million people
          around the world were living with a mental disorder, with anxiety and
          depressive disorders the most common (1). In 2020, the number of
          people living with anxiety and depressive disorders rose significantly
          because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial estimates show a 26% and 28%
          increase respectively for anxiety and major depressive disorders in
          just one year (2). While effective prevention and treatment options
          exist, most people with mental disorders do not have access to
          effective care. Many people also experience stigma, discrimination and
          violations of human rights.<br />
        </p>

        <h2>Anxiety Disorders</h2>
        <p>
          In 2019, 301 million people were living with an anxiety disorder
          including 58 million children and adolescents (1). Anxiety disorders
          are characterised by excessive fear and worry and related behavioural
          disturbances. Symptoms are severe enough to result in significant
          distress or significant impairment in functioning. There are several
          different kinds of anxiety disorders, such as: generalised anxiety
          disorder (characterised by excessive worry), panic disorder
          (characterised by panic attacks), social anxiety disorder
          (characterised by excessive fear and worry in social situations),
          separation anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive fear or
          anxiety about separation from those individuals to whom the person has
          a deep emotional bond), and others. Effective psychological treatment
          exists, and depending on the age and severity, medication may also be
          considered.<br />
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Depression</h2>
        <p>
          In 2019, 280 million people were living with depression, including 23
          million children and adolescents (1). Depression is different from
          usual mood fluctuations and short-lived emotional responses to
          challenges in everyday life. During a depressive episode, the person
          experiences depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty) or a loss
          of pleasure or interest in activities, for most of the day, nearly
          every day, for at least two weeks. Several other symptoms are also
          present, which may include poor concentration, feelings of excessive
          guilt or low self-worth, hopelessness about the future, thoughts about
          dying or suicide, disrupted sleep, changes in appetite or weight, and
          feeling especially tired or low in energy. People with depression are
          at an increased risk of suicide. Yet, effective psychological
          treatment exists, and depending on the age and severity, medication
          may also be considered.<br />
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Bipolar Disorder</h2>
        <p>
          In 2019, 40 million people experienced bipolar disorder (1). People
          with bipolar disorder experience alternating depressive episodes with
          periods of manic symptoms. During a depressive episode, the person
          experiences depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty) or a loss
          of pleasure or interest in activities, for most of the day, nearly
          every day. Manic symptoms may include euphoria or irritability,
          increased activity or energy, and other symptoms such as increased
          talkativeness, racing thoughts, increased self-esteem, decreased need
          for sleep, distractibility, and impulsive reckless behaviour. People
          with bipolar disorder are at an increased risk of suicide. Yet
          effective treatment options exist including psychoeducation, reduction
          of stress and strengthening of social functioning, and medication.<br />
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</h2>
        <p>
          The prevalence of PTSD and other mental disorders is high in
          conflict-affected settings (3). PTSD may develop following exposure to
          an extremely threatening or horrific event or series of events. It is
          characterised by all of the following: 1) re-experiencing the
          traumatic event or events in the present (intrusive memories,
          flashbacks, or nightmares); 2) avoidance of thoughts and memories of
          the event(s), or avoidance of activities, situations, or people
          reminiscent of the event(s); and 3) persistent perceptions of
          heightened current threat. These symptoms persist for at least several
          weeks and cause significant impairment in functioning. Effective
          psychological treatment exists.<br />
